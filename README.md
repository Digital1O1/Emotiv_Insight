[ INTRODUCTION ]

The intent of this project was the premise of my Master's thesis, which was to use the Emotiv Insight, a commerically available EEG headset to control an open sourced, electrical wheelchair with PLA-based 3d printed components that could be either retrofitted, or modified to fit any commonly available push wheelchair for those who don't have the financial resources and/or the physical capabilities to control an electric wheelchair.

My intial intentions were to control four directional LEDs by gaining access to the streaming EEG data since each EEG signal had to fall within a certain range while thinking either up,down,left, or right. However, gaining access to the streaming EEG data would require a montly subscription to Emotiv which cost around $100 as of the fall semester of 2018, since then Emotiv had implimented a multi-tier pricing, but regardless I wanted to avoid paying any sort of montly fee. Fortunately enough, I somehow stumbled upon the "Emotiv SDK - Community Edition"
